## Routing and DMZ 

This page will serve as a complete setup of the boxes below and a detailed guide on how to recreate these setup steps.

### Boxes + Configuration

Rw01:

#### Creating a user and defining them as a sudo user

```
sudo adduser username
# this command will prompt a user stup terminal process just type Y for all options

sudo usermod -aG sudo username

```
#### Setting hostname through terminal
`sudo hostnamectl set-hostname hostname`

Road warrior can be set up graphically or through a config file. The route taken herre was using nmtui. Nmtui can be triggered in the terminal and provides the user with a GUI to configure their box. 

#### Nmtui Process

The nessecarry things to check in nmtui:

***Edit a connection***
- Add the IP address with the /** notation. Add gateway and DNS servers to `10.0.17.2`
- Use the X to check off require IPv4 addressing
- Make sure to set IPv4 config to manual amnd IPv6 to Disabled
- 
***Activate a connection***
- Sometimes your connection cna be deactivated so make sure its activated
Set system hostname
- This will prompt a swystem hostname prompt you can change. Nessecary for our logs to be more organized.

#### Configuring FW

Configuring our fw differs as changes are made to the running configuration by entering `configure‚Äù mode`.  These changes are applied to the running configuration via `commit`.  The changes persist after reload only if you `save` them.  You leave configuration mode via the `exit` command. In practice this looks like:


##### Hostname Config
```
configure
set system host-name fw1-hostname
commit
save
exit 
```

##### Interface Assignemnt

First you have to delete any dhcp assignments on our fw:
```
show interfaces
```

```
delete interfaces ethernet eth0 address dhcp
delete interfaces ethernet eth1 address dhcp
commit
save
```

commit

save

exit

show network interfaces

```
configure
set system host-name
commit
save
exit
```
Once thstd complete we need to organize our open ethernet ports. This is down by adding a description before assignment:

```
configure
set interface eth0 description SEC350-WAN
commit
save
exit
```
Assigning our descriptions for DMZ and LAN are the same

```
configure
set interface eth1 description HOSTNAME-DMZ
set interface eth2 description HOSTNAME-LAN
commit
save
```
